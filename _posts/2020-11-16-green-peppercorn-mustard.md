This mustard has a wonderful kick; it is spicy, but in a very different way from the heat of chile or the sinus-invigorating horseradish. The ground green peppercorns give it a fun, flecked appearance.

## Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons green peppercorns
* 1/4 cup brown mustard seeds
* 1/4 cup white mustard seeds
* 1 teaspoon grated fresh turmeric root
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup water

### To Add After Fermentation

* 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
* 1 teaspoon sugar (optional)

## Preparation

* Combine the peppercorns, mustard seeds, turmeric, salt, and water in a blender. Blend until smooth. As the mustard seeds break down, they act as a thickening agent, and the mixture will become creamy. Keep blending until it reaches a paste consistency.
* Spoon your mustard into a pint jar, pressing out any air pockets as you go. When it is all in the jar, you may need to use a butter knife to work out any remaining pockets. Then screw the lid down tightly.
* Set the jar in a corner of the kitchen to ferment. Watch for air pockets forming in the mustard. If you see any, open the lid and press the mustard back down. If the lid starts to bulge, simply open it for a moment to burp the ferment.
* Allow to ferment for about 7 days. Mustards are ready to eat immediately, but the fermentation time gives them a nice, smooth acidity and brings them to a lower pH, which improves preservation.
* Following fermentation, open the lid (it may pop slightly as CO2 is released) and stir in the vinegar and the sugar, if using. If you're using sugar, it will take a little while for the sugar crystals to melt into the mustard. Let sit for about 10 minutes, stir again, and your mustard is ready to serve.
* Store the mustard in the refrigerator, where it will keep for up to 12 months.
