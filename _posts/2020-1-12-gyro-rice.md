# Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 1 tablespoon oil
* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 1/2 cups long-grain or Basmati rice
* 2 1/2 cups chicken broth
* freshly ground black pepper
* salt

# Preparation

Melt the butter over medium heat in a large Dutch oven. Add the turmeric and cumin and cook until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. 

Add the rice and stir to coat. Cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is lightly toasted, about 4 minutes.

Add the chicken broth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 15 minutes without disturbing.

Remove from the heat and allow to rest until the water is completely absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes.
