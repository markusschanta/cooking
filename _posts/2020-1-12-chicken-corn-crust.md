This is a wonderful meal on an autumn day, served with a crisp green salad. The slow-cooked chicken is packed full of flavour and the crust – gluten-free, rich and corny – makes for a welcome (and lighter) change to a heavier mash.

## Ingredients (Serves Six)

### Chicken Stew

* 850g chicken thighs, skinless and boneless
* 3 red onions, thinly sliced (500g)
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 5 large tomatoes, quartered (400g)
* 200ml passata
* 200g jarred roasted red peppers, drained and cut into 2cm thick rounds
* 15g dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids)
* 20g coriander, roughly chopped
* 3 tbsp rose harissa (60g)
* 2 tsp sweet smoked paprika
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* salt and black pepper

### Sweetcorn Batter

* 500g corn kernels
* 3 eggs
* 70g unsalted butter, melted
* 3 tbsp whole milk

## Preparation

* Heat the oil in a large sauté pan, for which you have a lid, on a medium high heat. Add the onions and fry for 8–9 minutes, stirring a few times, until caramelised and soft. Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic, harissa, paprika, chicken, 1 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently, then add the passata and tomatoes. Pour over 350ml of water, bring to the boil, then simmer on a medium heat, covered, for 30 minutes, stirring every once in a while.
* Add the peppers and chocolate and continue to simmer for another 35–40 minutes, with the pan now uncovered, stirring frequently, until the sauce is getting thick and the chicken is falling apart. Remove from the heat and stir in the coriander. If you are serving the chicken as it is (as a stew without the batter), it’s ready to serve (or freeze, once it’s come to room temperature) at this stage. If you are making the corn topping, spoon the chicken into a ceramic baking dish – one with high sides that measures about 20 x 30cm – and set aside.
* Preheat the oven to 180°C fan.
* Pour the butter into a blender with the corn, milk, egg yolks and ¾ teaspoon salt. Blitz for a few seconds, to form a rough paste, then spoon into a large bowl. Place the egg whites in a separate clean bowl and whisk to form firm peaks. Fold these gently into the runny corn mixture until just combined, then pour the mix evenly over the chicken.
* Bake for 35 minutes, until the top is golden-brown: keep an eye on it after 25 minutes to make sure the top is not taking on too much colour: you might need to cover it with tin foil for the final 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside for 10 minutes before serving.
