That’s right — butter in the salad dressing. It must be the holidays.

## Ingredients

* 340 g Brussels sprouts
* 40g hazelnuts
* 1 small or 1/2 large crisp, red apple
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
* 4 teaspoons lemon juice
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 tablespoons neutral oil

## Preparation

* Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 180°C. Spread the hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast until lightly golden-brown and the skins are peeling away, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a clean dish towel, wrap up the nuts, and let steam for a minute. Rub the nuts with the towel to remove as many skins as possible. Coarsely chop the nuts and set aside.
* Shave the Brussels sprouts by gripping the stem end with your fingers and using a mandoline to slice as thinly as possible down to the stem, or until the sprout is too short to safely slice. (Alternatively, you can use a food processor to shave the sprouts. Trim and discard the stems and use the slicing blade of the food processor to finely shred the sprouts.)
* Halve and core the apple, then use the mandoline to cut into 5-millimetre thick slices. Place the apple slices in a small bowl and toss with 2 teaspoons of the lemon juice to prevent browning; set aside.
* Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, swirling occasionally, until butter is dark brown and smells nutty. Immediately pour into a cup to stop the cooking. Let cool slightly.
* Place the vinegar, remaining 2 teaspoons lemon juice, and salt in a small bowl and whisk to combine. While whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in the brown butter until the dressing is thick and emulsified. Whisk in the oil. Pour the dressing over the Brussels sprouts and mix in thoroughly. Add the apples and nuts and toss to combine.
* Let the salad sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving. If making more than 2 hours ahead, add the nuts just before serving for best texture.
