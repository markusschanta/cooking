This is my collection of cooking recipes that I picked up over the years. Whenever I enjoy a recipe, I try to list it here. I do this for a number of reasons: so that these recipes can be shared with others easily, that any changes I make to the recipe (eg. less salt/more butter) are recorded somewhere and I don't forget about the recipe altogether.

The recipes on this site are tagged by [cuisine](/recipes/cuisine) (eg. [Thai](/recipes/cuisine/#thai)) and [type of dish](/recipes/type) (eg. [desert](/recipes/type/#desert)), so that they can be found easily when looking for a particular type of dish.

This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/). The data and along with the version history can be found on [Github](https://github.com/markusschanta/recipes/).
