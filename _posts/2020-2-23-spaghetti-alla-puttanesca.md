## Ingredients (Serves Four)

* 500g pound dried spaghetti
* 1 can crushed tomatoes
* 4 to 6 anchovy fillets, finely chopped
* 1/2 cup black olives, finely chopped
* 2 tablespoon capers
* 1/2 cup chopped parsley
* 4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* Salt and freshly ground pepper

## Preparation

* Bring a pot of water to boil. When boiling, season generously with salt and cook the pasta, stirring occasionally, until al dente.
* In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat, and sauté the garlic, anchovie and red pepper flakes until garlic is golden and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the olives and capers and stir to combine.
* Add the crushed tomatoes and lower the heat, bringing to a bare simmer. Cook for about 10 minutes or until the pasta is ready. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Add about 2/3 of the parsley and toss to combine.
* When pasta is al dente, transfer it to the sauce using tongs.
* Garnish the dish with the remaining chopped parsley and serve immediately.
