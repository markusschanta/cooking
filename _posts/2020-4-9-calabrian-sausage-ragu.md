## Ingredients (Serves Four)

* 500 g ground pork
* 200 g tomato juice
* 400 g chicken stock
* 150 g white wine
* 10 g smoked paprika
* 3 g fennel seeds
* 2 g marjoram
* 2 g chili flakes
* 5 g sea salt
* 40 g butter
* 15 g olive oil (1 tbsp)
* 20 g Pecorino

## Preparation

* Season the ground pork with the paprika, salt, chili, and fennel. Mix gently to keep that meat looking like sausage instead of meat paste.
* Heat olive oil over medium-high heat and lightly brown the sausage mixture.
* Once the meat is mostly brown, add the wine to deglaze, and scrape the bits of good, crispy meat from the bottom of the pot. Turn the heat down and let simmer until the wine is heavily reduced and the pan is almost dry.
* Add the tomato juice and let it reduce by half.
* Add the stock and continue to simmer until you have achieved "ragù consistency": the liquid will stick to the back of a spoon but still pool just a little bit on a plate.
* Add butter and marjoram leaves to the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper if needed.
