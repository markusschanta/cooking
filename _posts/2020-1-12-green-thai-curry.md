## Ingredients

* 500g boneless, skinless chicken breast (cut into bite-sized pieces)
* 200g aubergines
* 150g cooked bamboo shoots (cut into bite-size pieces)
* A handful of Thai basil leaves (or Italian ones)
* 3 tablespoons Green Curry Paste
* 400ml coconut milk
* 1 tablespoon of smooth peanut butter
* 3 to 4 tablespoons Thai fish sauce
* 3 lime leaves (whole)
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 1 tablespoon (palm) sugar
* 1 teaspoon of salt

## Preparation

Heat the oil in a saucepan over a high heat and add the curry paste. Stir-fry for 10 seconds until it is fragrant.

Reduce the heat to medium and add half the coconut milk. Cook for about 2 minutes until the green oil splits and rises to the surface.

Now add the remaining coconut milk. Add the sugar and the fish sauce, then season with a pinch of salt. Stir in the lime leaves and add the chicken to the pan. Add the aubergines and the bamboo shoots. Cook over a medium heat for 5â€“7 minutes until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in the basil leaves.

Ladle into serving bowls, garnish each one with some sliced chilli and a sprig of basil and serve with steamed rice.
